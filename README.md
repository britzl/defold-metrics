# Defold Metrics
Calculate and display performance metrics in Defold games.


# Installation
You can use Defold Metrics in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

	https://github.com/britzl/defold-metrics/archive/master.zip

Or point to the ZIP file of a [specific release](https://github.com/britzl/defold-metrics/releases).


# Usage
* In your game.project settings, go to Dependencies,and add https://github.com/britzl/defold-metrics/archive/master.zip.
* In the outline in your scene, right-click and "Add Game Object File" and choose "/metrics/fps.go"
* Change the position on the game object to ex 10, 20, 0 to make it visible.
* If you also want to use the Lua memory counter, add the "/metrics/mem.go" in the same way, but on position 10, 40, 0.

## FPS
The FPS counter uses socket.gettime() to get an accurate timestamp and calculates an average FPS based on a sequence of samples. The FPS counter can be used in several ways:

1. Using fps.go() - Draw FPS counter at game object world position using draw text
2. Using fps.script - Draw FPS counter at game object world position using draw text
3. Using fps.lua - Draw FPS counter at specified position or get current FPS


### fps.create(samples, format, position, color)
Create an instance of the FPS counter

**PARAMETERS**
* `samples` (number) - Optional sample count. This is the number of samples required before the module will calculate FPS. Defaults to 60.
* `format` (string) - Optional format to draw FPS in. Defaults to "FPS %.2f"
* `position` (string) - Optional position to draw FPS at. Defaults to v3(10, 20, 0)
* `color` (string) - Optional color to use when drawing FPS text. Defaults to v4(0,0,1,1)

**RETURNS**
* `instance` (table) - An FPS counter instance


### fps.update()
Call this once per frame. Once enough samples have been collected it is possible to call fps() to get the current FPS.


### fps.fps()
Get the current FPS, based on collected samples.

**RETURNS**
* `fps` (number) - The calculated FPS


### fps.draw()
Draw fps count text using `draw_debug_text`.



## Memory
The memory counter uses `collectgarbage("count")` to get the amount of Lua memory used. The memory counter can be used in several ways:

1. Using mem.go() - Draw memory usage at game object world position using draw text
2. Using mem.script - Draw memory usage at game object world position using draw text
3. Using mem.lua - Draw memory usage at specified position or get current memory usage


### mem.create(format, position, color, show_avarage, avarage_interval)
Create an instance of the memory counter

**PARAMETERS**
* `format` (string) - Optional format to draw memory usage in. Defaults to "MEM %dkb"
* `position` (string) - Optional position to draw memory usage at. Defaults to v3(10, 20, 0)
* `color` (string) - Optional color to use when drawing memory usage text. Defaults to v4(0,0,1,1)
- `show_avarage` (bool) - Shows an avarage memory usage during a set amount of frames
- `avarage_interval` (number) - The amount of frames to calculate the avarage memory usage for

**RETURNS**
* `instance` (table) - A memory counter counter instance


### mem.update()
Call this to get a new memory usage reading.


### mem.mem()
Get the current memory usage, in kilobytes.

**RETURNS**
* `mem` (number) - The Lua memory usage


### mem.draw()
Draw memory usage text using `draw_debug_text`.
